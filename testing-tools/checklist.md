# Inclusive Design Checklist

- [ ] Minify CSS and JS, and remove unused/redundant code
- [ ] Use screen reader and keyboard accessible HTML
- [ ] Make sure wording is concise, clear, and not monotonous
- [ ] Compress raster images
- [ ] Optimize SVG path data
- [ ] Make sure heading levels describe a logical section/subsection structure
- [ ] Only include heading elements where they introduce sections of content
- [ ] Remove potentially insensitive or uninclusive language (use 'singular they')
- [ ] Give video content captions and transcripts
- [ ] Make sure main body (paragraph) text is no smaller than the default (user agent) size
- [ ] Support 'pinch zoom' (remove `user-scalable=no` if present)
- [ ] Use relative units (`em`, `rem`, and `ch`), especially for font metrics
- [ ] Make sure styes and scripts are not render blocking
- [ ] Install a service worker and cache all applicable assets
- [ ] Use content-based, not device-specific, media queries
- [ ] Provide alternatives and/or descriptions for complex visualizations
- [ ] Include only clear, meaningful animations
- [ ] Make sure controls do not elicit unexpected or jarring behavior
- [ ] Do not include third parties that compromise user privacy
- [ ] Do not recreate supported and expected browser behaviors with bespoke scripts
- [ ] Support Windows high contrast mode (use images, not background images, if salient)
- [ ] Provide alternative text for salient images
- [ ] Apply `alt=""` or `aria-hidden="true"` to decorative images
- [ ] Make sure text and background colors contrast sufficiently
- [ ] Provide `<title>`s that name the site and the specific page
- [ ] Provide large touch 'targets' for interactive elements
- [ ] Use data tables (`<table>`) for data, not layout
- [ ] Make scrollable elements focusable for keyboard users
- [ ] Do not rely on color for differentation of visual elements
- [ ] Use consistent design patterns
- [ ] Ensure keyboard focus order matches visual layout
- [ ] Lazy load large image assets
- [ ] Do not hijack standard scrolling behavior
- [ ] Move focus between dialogs and the controls that invoked them
- [ ] Give all form elements permanently visible labels
- [ ] Give grouped form elements group labels
- [ ] Provide status and error messages as WAI-ARIA live regions
- [ ] Provide clear, unambiguous focus styles
- [ ] Employ well-balanced, highly legible fonts (not too complex or elaborate)
- [ ] Do not use very thin font faces
- [ ] Ensure states (pressed, expanded, invalid, etc) are communicated to assistive software
- [ ] Provide a default language and use `lang=[ISO code]` for sections in different languages
- [ ] Make controls look like controls; give them strong perceived affordance
- [ ] Underline links â€” at least in body copy
- [ ] Make sure all content belongs to a landmark element (`<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`, `<main>`)
- [ ] Avoid pure white and pure black visual designs (temper these shades)
- [ ] Mark invalid fields clearly and provide associated error messages
- [ ] Ensure content is not obscured through zooming (no fixed widths)
